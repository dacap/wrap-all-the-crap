                          Wrap All The Crap

                              Manifesto

Software sucks, but we can improve it. And the only way to improve
this world is wrapping it with a better layer. Our ideals are:

1. We need to go back to simpler software, wrapping all the crappy
   stuff.

2. We need better ways to learn and teach current technologies to our
   children. Wrap the details, those will be replaced later.

3. We need better tools and APIs to create software. Create wrappers
   around current libraries and create better tools.

4. If you use an API, wrap it, create your own, improve it, publish
   it.

5. After you wrap the crap, replace the lower layer or remove it
   completely.

6. Start again, but with our own layer, which is a crap too.
